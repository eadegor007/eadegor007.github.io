### Projects

### INVESTIGATING THE EARLY PREDICTION OF DEMENTIA USING MACHINE LEARNING 
This research developed the critical component of an AI application for the Prediction of the Cognitive Status for early detection and prevention of dementia. Using an Ensemble   Technique, this model combined 3 Machine Learning Techniques as the base model namely, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Algorithms while using ANN as the final estimator. The model was trained on the NACC dataset containing 21 features. The results of the model showed a 91% accuracy in predicting each of the various cognitive outcomes and provided a solid foundation for the detection of dementia at the earliest possible stage to facilitate focused treatment on specific cohorts that may delay or reverse cognitive deterioration in patients.


### TIME SERIES FORECASTING OF DEMAND TREND AND PRICE FOR STARTUP ONLINE RIDE-SHARING OPERATOR 
This project focuses on developing a robust time series forecasting model to predict demand trends and pricing strategies for a startup online ride-sharing operator. The goal is to enhance operational efficiency and profitability by accurately anticipating customer demand and optimizing pricing models in real-time.

Using historical data, including ride requests, pricing, and external factors such as weather and traffic patterns, I employed advanced time series models like ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM neural networks to forecast future trends. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to ensure accurate and actionable predictions.

The outcomes of this project provide the ride-sharing operator with insights into peak demand periods, enabling better fleet management, dynamic pricing adjustments, and overall improved customer satisfaction. The forecasting model is integrated into a dashboard, offering real-time updates and visualizations to support strategic decision-making.

### RADIOLOGY REPORT SUMMARIZATION AND DIAGNOSIS AID USING NLP
This Project focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically detect key information from radiology reports and generates summaries to assist radiologists in making accurate and efficient diagnosis. Using Named Entity Recognition (NER) Technique, we are able to identify key entities in the reports, such as anatomical locations, conditions and findings (including lung nodule, fracture or tumor). We were also able to extract critical details such as measurements (e.g size of a lesion), observed anomalies, and recommendations. This Projectwas integrated with existing radiology information systems and Picture Archiving systems (PACS) for seamless access to summaries. The Outcomes recorded included Enhanced Efficiency in reading and interpretung radiology reports, improved accuracy to help radiologists focus on the most critical aspects of each case, especially diagnoistic errors and better Decision Support for complex cases.
